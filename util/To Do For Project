	To Do For Project
		- fix exploding LSTM gradients
		- implement CNN and CNN plus LSTM
		- implement backups for DQN
		- continue berkeley course, look at policy gradient methods
		- add time of day and day of week fields
		- run experiments on data - compare table based methods vs regressions vs DLs
		- try random forest regressor as well
		- install tensorboard
		- gradient clips by global norm
		- write episode creator
		- try DQN without dynamic programming
		- extra noisy channels CNN
		- batching
